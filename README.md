# LimeQT - A simple SoapySDR wrapper with a Qt frontend
This project demonstrates a simple transceiver example using multiple threads for sending/receive and produce/consume. While this project definately does not cover all facettes of the SDR, it can still be used as a template/starting point for other applications.

## Dependencies
This project requires LimeSuite, SoapySDR and alglib (and QtCreator):

```sh
pacaur -S limesuite-git
pacaur -S soapysdr-git
pacaur -S alglib
```

## Build
Simply fire up QtCreator, load the LimeQt.pro and hit build.
